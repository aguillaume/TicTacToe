# TicTacToe
A simple game of Tic Tac Toe. 

The idea is to have two players build their own AI for playing a game of Tic Tac Toe and have a faceoff too see who has build the smarter/better player.


The player method needs to take a double array as a paramenter, have a method/function called 'move' and return an array with the coloum and row number for the move they want to make.
